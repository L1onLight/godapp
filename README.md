# GodApp

## Initialization

To initialize the project locally, create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.13 godapp
```

Activate the environment and install dependencies.

## Backend

Currently powered by Django (`godapp_main`). The backend structure is designed to accommodate future microservices and additional tools as the project scales.

## Frontend

A React project is planned for the frontend. Currently not installed.
